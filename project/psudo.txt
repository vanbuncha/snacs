randomly select N nodes from the graph

calculate each node's degree:
	select top N nodes

calculate each node's closeness centrality:
	select bottom N nodes

calculate each node's betweenness centrality:
	select top N nodes


Area of Repulsion:
	If node n is selected as a landmark, make sure that any node within the k neighbourhood is not selected


Partitioning:
	Parition the graph and then run each of these algorithms on each partition
	Paper's Implementation:
		for each partition pick the node with the highest degree and lowest closeness and highest betweenness
		border: for each partition pick a node close to the border with a high degree


Hybrid Landmark Selection:
	-->randomly select a roughly N/3 of nodes from each of the three centralities
	-->iterate through the top ranking nodes and select each one sequentially from each of the three measures until it selects N nodes


Computing Landmarks:
	for each node in G compute distance to each landmark
